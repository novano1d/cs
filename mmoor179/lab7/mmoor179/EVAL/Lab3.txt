Comments: The return value for last when there is no item is a bit problematic by design of what we
	  are trying to do, so it is alright to return a default constructed value.
	  In the future labs, we will see that this type of operation normally returns an iterator,
	  through which we can use the idea of returning NULL when there is no item to be returned.
