Points: 10

Comments: It is better to use "nullptr" instead of a dynamic array of zero size, but if you do use the
	  latter, you need to deallocate memory in the copy constructor and assignment operator overloading
	  function too. But you will always need to deallocate memory in the assignment operator overloading
	  function, which is missing too!
